Problem Statement:
Multi Modal Deepfake Detection Assistant
🌍Context:
Deepfakes, which are AI-generated videos, images, and text, are increasingly being used to spread misinformation, manipulate public opinion, and harm reputations. As synthetic media becomes more realistic, detecting such content is becoming significantly more difficult and urgent.

🧠Challenge:
Build a web-based AI tool that can detect deepfakes across multiple formats including video, image, and text. The system should use visual forensics such as facial artifacts and frame inconsistencies, analyze metadata anomalies, and apply natural language processing to flag suspicious language patterns. The interface should allow users to upload content, receive a deepfake confidence score, and view visual or textual explanations for why content was flagged.

🎯Goal:
Equip individuals, journalists, and digital platforms with an accessible and intelligent solution for verifying the authenticity of media, thereby helping combat misinformation and digital fraud.
