Project Name: Reveal AI
Unleash the real facts news 
🧠 THE REAL PROBLEM (SIMPLE):
Fake videos, photos, and texts are fooling people everywhere.
It’s getting harder to tell what’s real and what’s fake.
Journalists, social media users, and platforms are struggling to check if content is real or AI-generated.
There’s no simple tool that can quickly check all types of media (image, video, text) in one place.

🔥 Our JOB:
Build a tool where anyone can upload a video, image, or text,
and get a clear answer:
✅ Real or ❌ Fake — with a short explanation of why.
________________________________________
🧱 Our SOLUTION (CORE BLOCKS):
1.	Detect Image Fakes → Use AI to find weird things in faces, lighting, or metadata
2.	Detect Video Fakes → Catch fake lipsync, shaky movements, weird frames
3.	Detect Text Fakes → Spot unnatural language, GPT-like patterns, fake tone
4.	Show Score + Why → “This video is 92% fake. Lip-sync mismatch at 0:15s.”

🎯 FINAL Model GOAL:
Help normal people, journalists, and media know the truth about the content before they believe or share it.
